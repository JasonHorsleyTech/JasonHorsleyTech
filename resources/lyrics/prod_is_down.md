# Down, Prod is Down

Sung to the tune of "Downed and Drowned" by the Longest Johns

## Verse 1

* A junior dev deployed a fix
* Old PHP on nginx
* A trailing comma cause some runtime flack
* The long lost child ner came back

> It's down, Prod is down, 404'ed and can't be found.

## Verse 2

* Log files scroll, Eyes are strained
* Coffee cups are filled and drained
* And the junior dev that caused the fall
* Home, prepping leet for the FAANG call

> It's down, Prod is down, 404'ed and can't be found.

## Chorus

* It's down, quick let the seniors know
* Ping the sysadmin and the CTO
* Slack is ablaze with the "@here's" and "@all's"
* All of support answering angry calls.
