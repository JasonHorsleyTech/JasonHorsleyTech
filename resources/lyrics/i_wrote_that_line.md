# I wrote that line 

Sung to the tune of "I walk the line" by Johnny Cash

## Verse 1

* In a team so vast and intertwined,
* With each helper copied 20 times,
* Lived a date diff simple in design,
* Didn't keep in mind, Feb 29.

## Verse 2

* As a senior dev with clout and pride,
* A decade in, experience as my guide,
* I called a retrospective company-wide.
* Find who's to blame, who wrote that line.

## Verse 3

* In the git blame, a junior did arise.
* "that moron Dave, not really a surprise."
* But the commit, just a formatter applied.
* An older root, a deeper dive.

## Verse 4

* We checked the logs and found an old Slack thread.
* His name was Jeff, a good mid-level dev.
* “from backend core, the project that you led,
* A copy-paste.” Or so he said.

## Verse 5

* That backend core, the first project of mine,
* Back in a time when coding was divine.
* No long QA, just push, and then online.
* Pure speed and skill. Oh, what a time.

## Verse 6

* But now I wipe off all that soot and grime.
* Now that I check that code a second time,
* I find the man, the author of that line.
* God fucking damn, that line was mine.
