## Verse 1
Well I had a site, back two-thousand-n-three
Just a wordpress forum, cost close to free 
On a beat up debian dell from my fathers garage.

Now I though I was hot, a real system admin
Cause I could sudo apt-get with my root login
And hey, it was good enough to land a Junior Job.

## Verse 2
They asked if I knew cake, and I felt so behind
Introduced jQuery and it blew my mind
With my little notepad++ I was coding a storm

After some time, having bills on the way
My eyes started to wander for that mid level pay
And my skill, they said "Too old. It react WE adore"

## Verse 3
So I started slinging hooks and managing state
Poor lil' text input had so much on it's plate
But they said "Don't worry, lets bring in the Redux Store"

First grunt then gulp, then webpack too
The tools kept spinning, the old was new.
With a 30 second compile, web dev become kind of a chore.

## Verse 4
Next interview was senior, they asked for skills
But the list they wanted it game me a chill
it was about every language a man could know.

I felt a little timid but I had to ask
"Well what kind of stack is holding up this saas?"
They said "our outsourced team made it all, purely homegrown"

## Chorus
They wrote it one line at a time, and don't worry it runs just fine
Mute those Sentry alerts, there's nothing to fear
Yeah our server bills are high, just amazon's piece of the pie.
Our devs and EC2's are the "top tier"

## Outro
Well it's a 

Laravel, NodeJS, Tailwind for CSS
SASS, LESS, Tests with pest, MySequel and PostGress
Ruby, Objective C, ASP kind-of-a-stack

We've got some Falcon PHP, CodeIgniter and some Yii
The zendesk integration leverages some python3
