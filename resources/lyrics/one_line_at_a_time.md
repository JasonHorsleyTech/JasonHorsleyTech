# One line at a time

## Verse 1
Well I had a site, back two-thousand-n-three
Just a wordpress forum for close to free 
On a beat up debian dell from my fathers garage.

Now I though I was hot, a real system admin
Cause I could sudo apt-get with my root login
And hey, it was good enough to land a Junior Job.

## Verse 2
They asked if I knew cake, and I felt behind
They introduced jQuery and it blew my mind
With my little notepad++ I was coding a storm

After some time, having bills on the way
My eyes started to wander for that mid level pay
And my skill, they said "Too old. It react WE adore"

## Verse 3
So I started slinging hooks and managing state
Simple name input with so much on it's plate
They said "Looks like it's time for the Redux Store"

First grunt then gulp, then webpack too
The tools kept spinning, the old was new.
A 30 second compile time made my job a chore.

## Verse 4
Next interview was senior, they asked for skills
But the list they wanted it game me a chill
was about every language and tool a man could'a known.

I felt a little timid but I had to ask
"What kind of framework is holding up this saas?"
They said "our outsourced team did it purely homegrown"

## Chorus
They wrote it one line at a time, and don't worry it runs just fine
Mute those Sentry alerts, there's nothing to fear
Yeah our server bills are high, just amazon's piece of the pie.
Our devs and EC2's are the "top tier"

## Tech list
Well it's a 

Laravel, NodeJS, Tailwind for CSS
SASS, LESS, Tests with pest, MySequel and PostGress
Ruby, Objective C, ASP kind-of-a-stack

We've got some Falcon PHP, CodeIgniter and some Yii
The zendesk integration leverages some python3
Cron shell scripts sending data to the buckets out back 

## Verse 5
I needed the money cause rent ain't free
So I done tra-verse the damn binary tree
And I ar-ki-tected some boxes and arrowed lines

I was hired, they though I was swell | Assigned a 
10 point ticket, said "Give em hell"
But the work was a `<div>` no one else could vert align.

## Verse 6
I slapped on a flex box, item center class
Hoped I could spend the sprint my ass
Got it PRed, approved, and ready to deploy

But then the team lead said "Now hold on son"
Your USER STORIES aren't HALF way done
Then a requisition form to get some clusters for the staging convoy!

## Verse 7
Terraform began the cloud's orchestration
ansible scripts for IT's automation
Ku-ber-net-es pods scaling throughout night

A sea of containers for my one line change
Servers buckled and groaned under the strain
And god damn, my little old flex was a two week fight.

## Verse 8
I asked my boss "why not keep it light?"
It's just HTML with some styles, right?
Do we really need all this crap at the end of the day?"

He laughed and said "Think bigger friend,
It's all about scale, from end to end
We're ENGINEERS, not just coding up a webpage."

## Chorus 2
They wrote it one line at a time, and the PMs say it's fine
60 second loads that makes our users cry
Now I code in my free time, cause they made us all system design
But at least I'll make top dollar till I die.
