## Verse 1

Well I show up tuesday mornin' but I couldn't start the standup without my shirt
And the soymilk in my latte had gone bad But I drank it, to stay alert.
So I lead the team in standup stumblingly through pretending I'm an extrovert.
It like brushing teeth and orange juice, same #team channel groundhog day 

## Verse 2

Show I check the board for coding, just form or something simple to update
and I see a 1 point ticket on the backend, an emails that needs to validate
And I almost click "assign me", but my boss's voice say I should delegate
So I let out a big exhale, open zoom and put the IDE away.

--- Actual song below ---

## Chrous
On a Sunday mornin' sidewalk
I'm wishin', Lord, that I was **stoned**
'Cause there's somethin' in a Sunday
That makes a body feel **alone**
And there's nothin' short a' dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the _sound_
Of the sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' _down_

## Verse 4
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was **swingin**'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were **singin**'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was **ringin**'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearin' dreams of _yesterday_

## Chorus
On a Sunday mornin' sidewalk
I'm wishin', Lord, that I was **stoned**
'Cause there's somethin' in a Sunday
That makes a body feel **alone**
And there's nothin' short a' dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the _sound_
Of the sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' _down_
