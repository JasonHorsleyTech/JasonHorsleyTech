## Lessons

#### Be kind, not nice.

Learned the importance of direct, constructive feedback over avoiding conflict, ensuring accountability and growth.

At Pubbly, I had the responsibility to manage an outsourced developer from the Philippines. While initial progress was smooth, the developer began to lag in productivity. Instead of confronting the issue head-on and providing targeted guidance, I chose to sidestep the issue to avoid conflict. He missed his deadlines and ultimately lost the job. The lesson: I purchased the luxury of "I don't want to upset him" at his own expense.

Choose kindness over mere niceness.

#### Data talks

At MicroVentures, we moved from Laravel monolith to a SPA and API. Hooking into vue-router and axios, all requests and navigation events were logged. Using only a few tables, we could reconstruct complete site journeys. This level of granular tracking was absent when I transitioned ot Shelterluv, a startup with a less mature stack and fragmented tracking systems. Bugs were harder to isolate, slower to surface, and twice the time investment to fix.

We got approval for a "2 sprint rework". We prioritized tracking. A few months post release, it's clear the investment has paid off, and will only continue to compound.

#### There's more than you think

Discovered the complexities hidden in legacy codebases, emphasizing the need for thorough audits and realistic project scopes.

At MicroVentures, one of my early tasks was to decouple Vue pages from a Laravel monolith to create a SPA. Initial estimates were optimistic: "No more than a month," we said. I was excited to get started. As I dug in, I discovered forgotten, yet critical, features that had complex backend dependencies. Each discovery inflated the timeline, turning my 'one-month' project into a two-month ordeal.

The lesson here is twofold: 

* First, no 5 year old codebase is "simple". There are features the owner hasn't thought about in years, but once reminded, won't be able to live without. An in-depth audit before writing the first line of code is non-negotiable.

* Second, if the initial scoping feels protracted, consider it a red flag that the project is under-budgeted. Scoping is an early warning system.

## Personal

#### Goal
I am looking to move from "small team big goal" startup mentality to larger scale longer term.

#### Life
I used to live in Latin America with my wife, but after two kids we became substantially more boring.

Outside of software, I host game night, where I and the other neighborhood dads drink and play overly complicated board games. I also play accordion for a "Johnny Cash software-development-parody tribute band", link below.
